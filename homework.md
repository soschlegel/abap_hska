# Homework

The following task describes the Homework for the ABAP Course

## Story

I am working as ABAP Developers since some years, but I now want to learn some other programming language and technologies - but where to start and most interessting: *with what to start?*
Build for me a web-based Application, where I can see, what's the new cool and fancy stuff to learn!

## Requirements

* ABAP based Backend
* Web-Frontend
* Integrate some Validations
* Integrate any kind of Action

## Organisation

* Create a Git-Repository
* Package-Name YHSKA_##_HomeWork

## Optional Ideas for improvements

* Use Web-Service
* Use EML in any way
* Use some nice Visualization (i.e. [Star Rating](presentations/Bewertungssterne.pdf) )

## Important Notes

**If you use any composition between any kind of parent and child entity, then you should take a look at CDS-View */DMO/I_TRAVEL_M* and all related artifacts around to understand how *association to parent* works in combination with *composition [0..*] of* - otherwise you will for sure loose a lot of time**
